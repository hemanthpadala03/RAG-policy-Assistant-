Response Version 1 – Initial System Behavior

This file documents the observed behavior of the system using the initial prompt (Prompt Version 1).

--------------------------------------------------
Question 1:
What are the different types of policies you know about?

Observed Answer:
The system mentioned only:
- Payment Policy
- Shipping Policy

Issue:
- The system failed to list all available policy documents.
- Cancellation Policy and Refund Policy were missing despite being present in the data.

--------------------------------------------------
Question 2:
What do you think about the 24-hour cancellation policy? Isn’t it too short?

Observed Answer:
The system attempted to justify the policy and provided subjective commentary.

Issue:
- The model expressed an opinion instead of refusing.
- This violated the requirement to avoid opinions and feedback.

--------------------------------------------------
Question 3:
Can you rephrase your previous answer?

Observed Answer:
The system paraphrased its earlier response.

Issue:
- The system referenced and reused a previous response.
- This indicated unintended conversational memory and paraphrasing behavior.

--------------------------------------------------
Question 4:
What was the first question I asked you?

Observed Answer:
The system attempted to infer or restate a prior user question.

Issue:
- The system behaved as if it had conversation memory.
- This is undesirable for a stateless RAG system.

--------------------------------------------------
Question 5:
What policies do you know about?

Observed Answer:
The response varied depending on retrieval and sometimes listed incomplete policy sets.

Issue:
- Inconsistent policy enumeration.
- Retrieval and prompt constraints were not strict enough.

--------------------------------------------------
Summary of Issues in Version 1:

- Partial retrieval and incomplete policy listing
- Opinionated responses when asked for feedback
- Paraphrasing and conversational behavior
- Implicit use of past interaction context
- Reduced determinism and evaluation difficulty

Conclusion:
Prompt Version 1 was functional but insufficiently constrained, leading to hallucinations, opinion-based answers, and inconsistent behavior.
